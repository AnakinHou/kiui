<a id="why-" class="anchor" href="#why-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why ?</h1>

<p>Like I suppose, many gamedevs before me, coding UI has always been a source of discomfort.
I wanted to code my interfaces as I coded the rest. With a sense of freedom to organise everything however I felt the most natural.<br>
In most domains, when I have needed a library to do a specific task, I've been able to find a small and efficient library that would do just that and nothing more.<br>
That is true of database, pathfinding, message queuing, network, even rendering.<br>
Yet... the UI domain was rebellious. All the libraries I tried invariably forced me to write ugly code.</p>

<p>You can feel the lack of diversity in UI when you google the answers to question : what is a good UI library for games ?<br>
I even went to web-based UI at some point, and it taught me about some great features an UI solution should have. But I needed native UI.<br>
So, four months ago, I finally rolled up my sleeves, deciding that if there was one domain where I could bring something to the world, it was about UI.</p>

<p>Today, after four month, the library is good enough to start communicating about it on public channels like the gamedev community.
I hope to find here some enthusiasts first users, and get the word out, so that the library can grow toward stability over the following months.</p>

<h1>
<a id="what-makes-it-stick-out-" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-it-stick-out-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What makes it stick out ?</h1>

<p>Here are all the requirements and features that I strived to pack into this library :</p>

<ul>
<li>Logic code is separated from appearance code, for clean UI code writing</li>
<li>Layout is automatic, no manual positioning or sizing is ever needed (no messing with VSizers and HBoxes)</li>
<li>Appearance is completely tweakable both through Style Sheets and directly from code</li>
<li>Vector based skinning (borders, rounded corners, gradients, shadows)</li>
<li>Game friendly image based skinning (9 sprites)</li>
<li>Basic widgets : dropdown, slider, checkbox, text input, multiline text, filtered dropdown</li>
<li>Toolkit widgets : dockspace, dockable windows, tabs, docking bar, tables, trees</li>
<li>Fit for both an editor UI and a game UI</li>
<li>Core library is completely standalone and self contained</li>
<li>Has a nifty standalone renderer using the really good NanoVG vector drawing library</li>
</ul>

<p>Technical specs :</p>

<ul>
<li>Modern C++ (in the limit of my young knowledge)</li>
<li>Cross-Platform (tested under gcc, clang and msvc as of now)</li>
<li>Free as in beer and as in speech : MIT license</li>
<li>Runs in browser through Emscripten</li>
<li>Lightweight : small codebase of around 15kLoC, 600kB footprint for the .dll on windows</li>
</ul>

<a id="whats-the-catch-" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-catch-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the catch ?</h1>

<p>Well kiUi is still in its infancy. It is a work in progress, with an API that is not stable yet.
There is virtually no documentation as of now, although I believe the code to be quite clean and self-explanatory.
And now that it's close to being feature-complete I'll have time to write docs and tutorials.</p>

<h1>
<a id="so-what-now-" class="anchor" href="#so-what-now-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what now ?</h1>

<p>Well if you have a project like mine, a game with quite a lot of UI design and possibly a toolset or an editor, consider using it !</p>

<p>Here is the github repository where the real stuff happens : <a href="https://github.com/hugoam/kiui">https://github.com/novembermonk/kiui</a></p>

<p>Happy to share it, and happy to hear any kind of feedback, bug reports in the future. (I'm exposing myself to a shitstorm of issue reports, I know ;) )</p>
